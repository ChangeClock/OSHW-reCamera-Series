# Introduction

## What's reCamera?

reCamera is the combination of a **processor** with a **camera sensor**.

This combination makes reCamera a standalone system which could handle some basic detection & control tasks along.

## Why we make reCamera?

Today, as the processors (both SOC and MCU) are becoming smaller and powerful, putting the processor together with camera sensors are becoming doable. Indeed many IPCs (IP camera) are already using this design to acclerate AI detection on edge devices. 

So today we make reCamera, this open-source camera platform for everyone to play with. And we split this project into 3 changable parts:
- Core Board
- Sensor Board
- Base Board

This design will let you to easily change the interfaces, camera sensors to the ones you want to use. And we hope these componenets could be freely used as any combination.  

And after we could build up this hardware platform and ecosystem, other applications could grow on these platform without a worriness of changing from platform to platform in the future.

## Core Board

| Board         | Features                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [C1_2002w]    | eMMC <br />WIFI/BLE module <br /> OnBoard antenna <br /> External antenna connector|
| [C1_2002]     | eMMC |

#### C1_2002w
This core board utilized the SOC SG2002. In addition to the on-board eMMC, there are also on-board wireless solution ready for use. The wireless module along with the on-board antenna could provides you the basic WIFI/BLE connection ability.

While the on-board antenna cannot have a good long-range performace, you could also choose to use external antenna with the IPEX connector on-board.
